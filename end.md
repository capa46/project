4. Discussion
   
Challenges we faced and solutions:

The knowledge graph is still lacking some more detailed information. E.g.: lack of IRIs, authors.

Find the right information to avoid wrong queries > run different queries

LLMs are useful but they must be used carefully and they must be precisely instructed.

ChatGPT and Gemini bugs > correct them or ask other questions


5. Conclusions and possible future developments
   
Summing up:

Previuos analysis of the entities

Creation of new triples to fill knowledge gaps

Correction of existing data

Future developments:

Further enrichment of the ArCo ontology: constant update and easy access for laymen.

Future development of LLMs
